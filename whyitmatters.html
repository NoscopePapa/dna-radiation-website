      <h2>Why It’s Important to Know the Truth</h2>
      <p>
        At first, myths about radiation and mutation might just seem like harmless fun — after all, they’re mostly used in games, comics, and movies. But the way these stories shape how we think about science can actually have real-world consequences. If people grow up believing that radiation causes instant powers or monster mutations, it can make it harder to understand how things actually work.
      </p>
      <p>
        One major problem is <strong>fear and misunderstanding</strong>. Radiation is used in medicine (like X-rays and cancer treatment), in energy (nuclear power), and in scientific research. When people don’t know the facts, they might avoid safe medical procedures or protest against things that aren’t actually dangerous. That can slow down progress and even put lives at risk.
      </p>
      <p>
        Another issue is how myths lead to <strong>distrust in science</strong>. If someone believes that scientists are hiding the truth or that radiation is more dangerous than it is, they might be less likely to trust real experts. This kind of thinking spreads quickly, especially online, where conspiracy theories and fake “science” are everywhere.
      </p>
      <p>
        These misunderstandings also affect how we respond to real events. During the Fukushima disaster, many people panicked — even those far away from Japan. Some believed food would become radioactive or that wildlife would mutate. These fears were based more on what people saw in fiction than in facts.
      </p>
      <p>
        Knowing the real science helps us make smarter decisions. It lets us understand the risks and benefits of radiation and genetic research without falling for myths. It also helps people become more responsible media consumers. Just because something looks cool in a game or movie doesn’t mean it reflects reality.
