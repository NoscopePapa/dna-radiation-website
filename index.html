      <h2>Welcome to the DANGER ZONE</h2>
      <p>
        Radiation and DNA mutations are often shown in movies, games, and comics in wild and unrealistic ways. Whether it’s a superhero bitten by a radioactive spider or people turning into mutants after a nuclear explosion, these stories have shaped how a lot of people think about science. But the truth is way more complex — and way less flashy.

        This website was created to clear up those myths. It dives into what radiation actually is, how it interacts with DNA, and what really happens when someone is exposed to it. You’ll also see how popular media like <em>Fallout</em>, <em>Spider-Man</em>, <em>The Hulk</em>, and <em>Metro Exodus</em> have spread fun but totally wrong ideas about mutation. Through real science, real history, and real examples, you’ll see how the facts compare to fiction.

        Each page covers a different part of the topic, with visuals and explanations that aim to be both clear and interesting. This project is meant to show that science can be just as fascinating as fiction — even if it doesn’t come with glowing monsters or superpowers.

        Use the menu above to move between pages. You’ll learn what radiation is, what mutations are, how they’re connected, and why it’s important to understand the difference between pop culture myths and actual biology. This knowledge matters, especially in a world where science is often misunderstood or misrepresented.
