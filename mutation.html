      <h2>What Is a Mutation, Really?</h2>
      <p>
        The word “mutation” often brings up images of superheroes, glowing skin, or freakish powers. But in real biology, a mutation is simply a change in your DNA — and most of the time, it’s not that dramatic. Mutations are a natural part of how life works, and they happen to everyone.
      </p>
      <p>
        DNA is the instruction manual for your body. It’s made of long chains of molecules called nucleotides, which are arranged in specific sequences (A, T, C, and G). These sequences form genes, which tell your cells how to build proteins — the building blocks of your body. A mutation is any change in this sequence.
      </p>
      <p>
        Mutations can happen in a few ways. Sometimes a single letter in the DNA gets swapped (called a point mutation), or a piece of DNA gets deleted, added, or duplicated. These changes might happen randomly during cell division, or they might be triggered by things like radiation, certain chemicals, or even viruses.
      </p>
      <p>
        Not all mutations are harmful. In fact, most have no noticeable effect at all. Some are neutral, and a few might even be helpful — for example, a mutation that gives someone natural resistance to a disease. However, harmful mutations can cause problems like genetic disorders or increase the risk of cancer.
      </p>
      <p>
        When we talk about mutations caused by radiation, we’re usually talking about damage to DNA that the body’s repair systems can’t fully fix. If a mutation happens in a gene that controls how cells grow or divide, it could lead to uncontrolled cell growth — also known as cancer. But it doesn’t happen instantly, and it doesn’t give you powers or make you mutate into something else.
      </p>
      <p>
        It’s also worth mentioning that evolution is powered by mutations. Over many generations, small random mutations can add up to big changes in species. But this process takes thousands or even millions of years, not a single dramatic event.
      </p>
      <p>
        So while mutations are a big deal in genetics, they’re not magical. They’re just part of how biology works. To understand how radiation can cause mutations, let’s look more closely at what happens to DNA when it’s exposed — that’s next.
