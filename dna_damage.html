      <h2>What Actually Happens to DNA</h2>
      <p>
        So, now that we know what a mutation is, how does radiation actually cause it? The short answer: by damaging DNA at the molecular level. It doesn’t give you powers or new body parts — it just messes with your genetic code, and usually in a bad way.
      </p>
      <p>
        The kind of radiation that can mutate DNA is called <strong>ionizing radiation</strong>. This includes X-rays, gamma rays, and some types of ultraviolet (UV) light. These rays are powerful enough to break chemical bonds inside your cells, including those in DNA. When this happens, the DNA strand can get bent, broken, or rearranged.
      </p>
      <p>
        There are a few ways this damage can happen. Radiation can cause:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Single- or double-strand breaks in the DNA helix</li>
        <li>Base changes (swapping the "letters" in your DNA)</li>
        <li>Free radical formation — unstable molecules that attack DNA and proteins</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        Your body does have repair systems to fix DNA damage. In many cases, your cells will catch the mistake and either fix it or destroy the damaged cell. But if the system fails, the mutation can remain. And if that mutation affects important genes, like ones that control how cells grow or divide, it can lead to serious problems like cancer.
      </p>
      <p>
        These effects aren’t instant, either. Unlike in comics or games, radiation doesn’t cause immediate, dramatic changes. Instead, damage builds up over time, especially with high or repeated exposure. Even then, the most common outcomes are cell death or long-term health issues — not cool new powers.
      </p>
      <p>
        One important note: not every mutation caused by radiation is visible or noticeable. You might not feel anything at first. That’s part of what makes radiation so dangerous — you don’t always know it’s causing harm until years later.
      </p>
      <p>
        In short, radiation mutates DNA by breaking it apart, and while your body can sometimes repair it, the risk of long-term consequences is real. That’s why scientists and doctors handle radiation so carefully in medicine, energy, and research.
