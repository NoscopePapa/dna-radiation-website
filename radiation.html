      <h2>Understanding Radiation</h2>
      <p>
        When most people hear the word “radiation,” they imagine something dangerous — glowing green sludge, nuclear explosions, or characters getting powers. But radiation is actually a natural part of our world, and it’s not always harmful. In fact, we’re surrounded by it every day.
      </p>
      <p>
        Radiation is simply energy that travels through space. It comes in many forms, from visible light and radio waves to X-rays and gamma rays. Scientists split radiation into two main categories: <strong>non-ionizing radiation</strong> and <strong>ionizing radiation</strong>. The difference between them is important, especially when it comes to health and DNA.
      </p>
      <p>
        Non-ionizing radiation includes things like radio waves, microwaves, and infrared light. This kind of radiation doesn’t have enough energy to damage DNA or cells. It’s used in things like Wi-Fi, microwave ovens, and phone signals. Some people worry about these devices, but science shows that they don’t pose the kind of risk that causes mutation.
      </p>
      <p>
        Ionizing radiation is more powerful. It includes X-rays, gamma rays, and some forms of ultraviolet (UV) radiation. This type can damage atoms in your cells, including DNA. That’s why doctors use lead vests during X-rays, and why we wear sunscreen — to protect ourselves from UV damage. At high doses, ionizing radiation can lead to health problems, including cancer.
      </p>
      <p>
        It’s important to understand that radiation is not automatically dangerous. It’s all about the type, amount, and exposure time. We’re exposed to background radiation every day from natural sources like the sun, the earth, and even certain foods. Most of it is harmless in small amounts.
      </p>
      <p>
        So, while radiation can be dangerous in large or uncontrolled doses, it’s not some mysterious force that causes instant changes like in the movies. The next step is learning how radiation interacts with our DNA — which you can read about on the next page.
