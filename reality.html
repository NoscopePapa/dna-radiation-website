      <h2>What Actually Happens in Real Radiation Disasters</h2>
      <p>
        Radiation in fiction often leads to glowing skin, powers, or monster mutations. In real life, radiation exposure is much less exciting — and a lot more dangerous. When people are exposed to high levels of ionizing radiation, the results are things like burns, cell death, cancer, and long-term health problems.
      </p>

      <h3>Hiroshima and Nagasaki (1945)</h3>
      <p>
        The atomic bombs dropped during World War II didn’t just destroy buildings. They exposed thousands of people to intense radiation. Many victims died instantly, while others suffered radiation sickness — with symptoms like vomiting, bleeding, and hair loss. In the years after, survivors faced higher rates of cancer. However, widespread “mutations” like in pop culture didn’t happen. Children born later didn’t show major genetic changes.
      </p>

      <h3>Chernobyl Disaster (1986)</h3>
      <p>
        One of the worst nuclear accidents in history, the explosion at the Chernobyl power plant released huge amounts of radioactive material. Firefighters and workers who were closest to the blast suffered extreme radiation burns and died within weeks. Long-term effects included an increase in thyroid cancer, especially among children. Despite the myths, there were no human “mutants” — only serious medical consequences.
      </p>

      <h3>Fukushima (2011)</h3>
      <p>
        After a massive earthquake and tsunami, the Fukushima plant in Japan suffered a meltdown. The radiation release was smaller than Chernobyl, and thanks to fast evacuations, the health effects were more limited. Still, there was widespread fear and misinformation, with people wrongly believing there would be mass mutations or glowing wildlife. In reality, the main impact was stress, fear, and a rise in cancer screenings.
      </p>

      <p>
        These real-life cases show that radiation can be deadly and damaging, but not in the way pop culture suggests. The danger is slow, invisible, and hard to detect — not instant mutation. Understanding the truth helps us respond properly when accidents happen, without falling for dramatic myths.
